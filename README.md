# BikeRental
Problem Statement
Predict the bike rental count per hour based on the environmental and seasonal settings (such as weather, day, time, humidity, wind speed, season etc).

Learning Objectives
At the end of the mini-project, you will be able to :

perform data exploration and visualization
perform Data preprocessing
apply ML algorithms on Bike Sharing dataset
calculate the MSE value of regression techniques
Dataset Description
The dataset chosen for this mini-project is a modified version of Bike Sharing Dataset. This dataset contains the hourly count of rental bikes between the years 2011 and 2012 in the capital bike share system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information. This dataset consists of 17379 instances of each 14 features.

Bike sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return has become automatic. Through these systems, the user can easily rent a bike from a particular position and return to another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousand bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. As opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position are explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that the most important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.
